# API Calling Flow

API Calling Flow is a Android library which can help you to simplify handling different conditions while calling an API (Web Service) in Android.

Download example App [here](https://github.com/RohitSurwase/API-Calling-Flow/raw/master/api-calling-flow-example.apk) or checkout [example](https://github.com/RohitSurwase/API-Calling-Flow/tree/master/example-app).

## Features

* Internal Network State Checking.
* On screen Setting's shortcuts to enable Wi-FI or Mobile Data.
* Hide unloaded screen during API call and show progress bar with white or transparent background.
* "Try Again" same API after enabling Network connection.
* Call API only if the Network connection is enabled.
* Remove progress bar after successfully loading data on screen.
* Show full-screen errors to users and hide unloaded screen from user for better user experience.

## Setup
In your Project's build.gradle file:

	allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
			...
		}
	}

In your Application's or Module's build.gradle file:


	dependencies {
  	  ...
      compile 'com.github.RohitSurwase.API-Calling-Flow:api-calling-flow:1.0'
      ...
	}

## Screenshots
Case 1. when Network connection is not available-

Case 2. When Network connection is available and API is successful-

|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Network Connection is available | API requested | API successful, data loaded |


Case 3. When Network connection is available but API is failed-

| <img src="https://github.com/RohitSurwase/API-Calling-Flow/raw/master/screenshots/Dummy_1_Connected.png" alt="Network Connection is available"   width="200" height="350" title="Network Connection is available" />  | <img src="https://github.com/RohitSurwase/API-Calling-Flow/raw/master/screenshots/Loading_2.png" alt="API requested"   width="200" height="350" title="API requested" /> | <img src="https://github.com/RohitSurwase/API-Calling-Flow/raw/master/screenshots/Error.png" alt="API failed, error shown"   width="200" height="350" title="API failed, error shown" /> |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Network Connection is available | API requested | API failed, error shown |


## Code Example

Refer to the [example](https://github.com/RohitSurwase/API-Calling-Flow/tree/master/example-app) for complete implementation and usage. 

* Step 1: Get reference to root layout of Activity or Fragment. Root layout can be any ViewGroup

Example-

	RelativeLayout parentLayout = (RelativeLayout) findViewById(R.id.rootLayout);
    

* Step 2: Crete Object of ApiCallingFlow and implement methods.
	 * 1st parameter - **context**
	 * 2nd parameter - **parentLayout** from step 1
	 * 3rd parameter - **true** for transparent background, **false** for default white background
* Step 3: Pass function to call current API on click of try again.
	 
		private void requestTestApi() {
  		...
      
		ApiCallingFlow apiCallingFlow = new ApiCallingFlow(this, parentLayout, false) {
			@Override
			public void callCurrentApiHere() {
				//Step 3: Pass function to call current API
				requestTestApi();
			}
		};
    
		...
		}


* Step 4: Get current Network state using **apiCallingFlow.getNetworkState()** and request API accordingly.
* Step 5: Call **apiCallingFlow.onSuccessResponse()** in API success function.
* Step 6: Call **apiCallingFlow.onErrorResponse()** in API error function.
